CS Collections – Mini E-Commerce Web Application

The goal of this task is to develop a simple yet visually appealing E-Commerce Web Application named CS Collections. This project involves designing and implementing a product display page where users can browse items, view product images, check prices, and add products to their shopping cart. The core objective is to create an interactive shopping experience using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on backend or database integration.

The webpage should include a responsive header, a grid-based product showcase section, and a real-time shopping cart interface. Each product card must contain a product image, name, price, and an “Add to Cart” button. When the user clicks the button, the selected product should be dynamically added to the cart and the total price should update instantly. JavaScript should be used to manage cart data, update the DOM, and display all selected items in a clean, readable format. A notification or alert should be shown confirming the addition of an item.

The user interface should follow a clean design using a soft color palette, rounded edges, light shadows, and hover animations. The layout must remain mobile-friendly and visually consistent. The footer should present the brand name and year.

In summary, the task demonstrates understanding of front-end development, UI design, and basic JavaScript logic through the creation of a functional mini-shopping interface. This project can be expanded later by adding product filtering, search functionality, user login, and backend integration.
